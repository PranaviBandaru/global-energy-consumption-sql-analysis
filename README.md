🌍 World Wide Energy Consumption Analysis (MySQL Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global energy consumption data using MySQL.
It examines the relationship between:

Energy production

Energy consumption

CO₂ emissions

GDP

Population

across multiple countries and years.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights that help understand how energy usage impacts economic growth and environmental sustainability.

🎯 Problem Statement

Global energy demand is increasing due to:

Population growth

Industrial development

Economic expansion

This leads to higher emissions and environmental challenges.

This project analyzes worldwide energy data to:

Identify trends and patterns

Compare countries

Measure sustainability indicators

Support data-driven energy planning

🗂️ Database Schema

📊 Key Insights

Energy consumption is higher in countries with strong economies.

Fossil fuel–dependent nations produce more emissions.

Population growth increases total emissions, but per-capita emissions vary.

Developed countries show better energy efficiency.

Economic growth and energy usage are strongly correlated.
